# Who is Dijkstra?
Edsger W. Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist and a pioneer in the field of programming. Born in 1930, he made numerous contributions to computer science, but one of his most famous works is the Dijkstra Algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph, a concept that’s foundational for modern navigation apps, computer networks, and more.

Dijkstra believed in solving problems elegantly and efficiently. His algorithm, created in 1956, remains one of the simplest yet powerful tools in computer science.

# How Does Dijkstra's Algorithm Work?
Imagine you are in a big playground, and you want to walk from one spot to another without getting too tired. But there are many paths to take, and some of them are shorter or easier than others.

Here’s how you can find the shortest path:

1. Start where you are now. That’s your starting point.
2. Look at all the paths you can take to the places next to you. Write down how long each path is.
3. Choose the shortest path to go to the next place.
4. Once you arrive there, do the same thing again: check all the paths, write down their distances, and choose the shortest one.
5. Keep doing this until you get to your destination.

In simple terms:

Always pick the shortest route you know so far.
Update the distances as you go along.
In the end, you’ll have found the easiest, shortest way to get to where you want to go!

# How Does Dijkstra's Algorithm Work? (The Real Way)

Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to determine the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in a weighted graph. Here’s the step-by-step explanation:

Components of the Problem:
- Graph: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- Weights: Each edge has a weight (cost), which is a numerical value representing the "distance" or "cost" between two nodes.
- Source: The starting node from which the algorithm begins.

# Real-World Applications
Dijkstra’s Algorithm is widely used in:

- GPS Navigation: Finding the shortest route from your location to your destination.
- Network Routing: Optimizing data packet transmission in networks.
- Gaming: Calculating paths for characters in strategy games.



Nesse gráfico temos dois tipos de entidades:
- Vértices: S, A, B e C
- Caminhos, onde são colocados os valores para travessia
Digamos que cada vértice é uma cidade e cada linha que liga as cidades são estradas. Para ir de uma cidade para outra se gasta tempo, esse tempo está estampado na linha.

Note que temos um caminho partido de S para A e outro partindo de S para B. Seguindo um simples lógica o caminho mais curto entre S e B seria ir direto de S para B, porém o tempo de travessia é de 3 minutos, se formos primeiro para A e depois para B gastaremos apenas 2 minutos (1 minuto de S para A e 1 minuto de A para B), sendo o caminho mais rápido e consequentemente mais curto. 

- Agora qual o caminho mais curto partindo de da cidade S para cidade C?
    Se você respondeu:
    - Partindo de S para A, depois de A para B e finalmente de B para C, concluindo o trajeto em 6 minutos, **você acertou!**
Isso é basicamente o algoritmo de Dijkstra, mas agora vamos ver exatamente como ele é executado...

# Como o algoritmo é resolvido? 
## 1. Primeiro passo:
Vamos considerar 2 tipos de vértices, os explorados e os inexplorados
# INSERIR TABELA DE VÉRTICES
- No começo todos os vértices são inexplorados. Vamos representar os vértices na tabela do seguinte jeito:
$$Vertex^{DP}$$
- D: The minimun distance from the source to that vertex. The path used must only have explored vertices
- P: The parent of that vertex

1. The distance from the source S to the vertex S is 0, because they are the same so:
    - D: 0
    - P: No parent
    $$Vertex^{0}$$
2. Find a path to vertex A from the source that consist only explored vertices, there are no explored vertices. If there is no path we say that the distance of the vertex is $\infty$
3. The same goes to B and C 
--- 
1. Now we set the vertex in the unexplored section whi the least distance to explored, beeing S, so now S is explored.
2. Now that S is explored, we can go from S to A with a distance of 1, so:
    - D: 1
    - P: S
    $$Vertex^{1S}$$
---
1. We repeat the same steps to B
    - D: 3
    - P: S
    $$Vertex^{3S}$$
--- 
1. There is no path between S and C using only S, so the distance dont change beeing $\infty$.
--- 
1. Now we take the least distance vertex from the unexplored site to the explored site, beeing $Vertex^{1S}$


# Conclusion
Dijkstra’s Algorithm is an elegant solution for finding the shortest path in a graph. While it’s simple to understand, its real-world impact is massive, powering technologies we use every day.
If you’ve ever wondered how your GPS app finds the fastest route, you now know—Edsger Dijkstra’s work is behind the magic!
