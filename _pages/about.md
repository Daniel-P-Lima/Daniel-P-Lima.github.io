Hello and welcome to my website! I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná (PUCPR) in Curitiba, while working as a full-stack developer at CSLR-WGA. Feel free to explore and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything!

This website highlights my personal projects and university experiences. The blog features topics I enjoy and want to share, whether they're related to technology or not.
